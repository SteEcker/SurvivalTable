<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This app is a submission for the 2020 RStudio Table Contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The interactive table compares the probabilities for three clinically relevant endpoints of two <em>hypothetical </em>studies, using Kaplan-Meier estimates at variable time-points.</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> It uses data based on the National Wilm&rsquo;s Tumor Study (NWTCO) to compare the outcome of an</span> <span style="color: #2f8e91;">ongoing study (NWTCO4)</span> <span style="color: #ffffff;">with a reference study (Reference).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">For each endpoint (Local control, Survival, Cancer specific survival) the outcome is calculated for the overall cohort and individual sub-groups (Group). If the survival probability of NWTCO4 is greater than the reference it is highlighted in</span> <span style="color: #008000;">green</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Confidence intervals (CI) and number at risk are displayed for the ongoing study as well. Expanding one of the Endpoints shows the corresponding KM-Plot with the reference study (blue) and ongoing study (red).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The data for this app is fictional. It has been adapted for illustration purposes and has <strong> no clinical relevance </strong>.</span></p>
